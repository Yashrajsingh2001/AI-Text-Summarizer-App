## AI Text Summarizer with Node.js

This project provides a Node.js application for text summarization using the TextMaster AI API.

### Features

* Summarize text using TextMaster AI's API.
* Integrates with Express.js for a simple server-side application.

### Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.

**1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `your-repo-name` with the name of your forked repository.

**2. Install Dependencies**

Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

**3. Create a `.env` File**

The application requires an access token for the TextMaster AI API. You can obtain your own token by creating a TextMaster account and following their API documentation for access token generation. 

**Important:** Do not commit the `.env` file to your Git repository, as it might contain sensitive information.

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the following line, replacing `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your actual token:

```
ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

**4. Run the Application**

Start the server with:

```bash
npm start
```

This will typically start the application on port 3000 (default for Express). You can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

**5. Text Summarization (Example)**

The specific way to interact with the application for text summarization depends on how it's implemented. Refer to any additional instructions or code comments within the project for details on how to provide text for summarization.
